# LU Decomposition Calculator

A web-based calculator that performs LU decomposition on any square matrix using **Gaussian elimination**. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it dynamically computes and displays the **L** and **U** matrices with LaTeX-style formatting using MathJax.

## OVERVIEW

**LU decomposition** factors a square matrix **A** into two triangular matrices:

\[
A = LU
\]

- **L** is a lower triangular matrix (with 1s on the diagonal)
- **U** is an upper triangular matrix (in row echelon form)

This decomposition simplifies solving systems of linear equations, computing determinants, and inverting matrices.
